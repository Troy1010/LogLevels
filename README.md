# LogLevels
This is an OBSE plugin. It adds log-level functionality. A normal use case would be:
	While development is in progress, the ini can be edited so that it has a higher log level, showing more logs.
	Then, after development is complete, the ini can be edited so that it has a lower log level, showing less logs.

When building, make sure to open LogLevels/LocalConfig.props and update with your local paths.
